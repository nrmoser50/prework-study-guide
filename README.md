# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to build a simple and functional website to illustrate my ability to read and understand directions.

The problem this study guide solves is showing the struggle and continuing on throughout the project. I learned that I can do hard things and how often my default setting seems to be "oh this is difficult, I quit." Yet, I'm already learning as much about coding as I am myself throughout this process.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

It's straightforward. Each section denotes which language is responsible for which layer of the webpage. I messed around with the CSS until I didn't know what I was doing so I just left it. Again, it got difficult so I moved on with the project.

## Credits

Me, myself, and I.
